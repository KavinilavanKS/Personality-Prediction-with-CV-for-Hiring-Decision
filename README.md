# Personality-Prediction-with-CV-for-Hiring-Decision
## About
The conventional hiring procedure is a laborious and time-consuming procedure. Making a wise
and equitable hiring choice is crucial to ensuring that both the candidate and the business benefit from the recruiting process. Aptitude exams, technical assessments, group talks, and HR interviews make up the conventional hiring procedure. The procedure has been reduced to a compact one with the same level of precision—if not more, thanks to the curated system. It's possible that the conventional hiring and selecting procedure doesn't always provide an outcome that is equitable. The suggested approach significantly enhances the likelihood of making equitable judgments. For a seamless and effective deployment, the suggested solution makes use of Flask, Firebase, Natural Language Toolkit, and Logistic Regression. The Big Five Personality Model, which uses the OCEAN values—Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism—as a means of predicting an individual's personality, is the foundation of the personality questionnaire.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
In the modern day, both companies and candidates may complete the application and hiring
processes with ease. Our proposed system is an online application- based method that properly picks candidates in an unbiased manner. Recruiters may select candidates based not only on the hiring committee's needs but also on the candidate's general disposition, as our technology evaluates the personality of the applicants. Compared to conventional methods, using an online recruiting system reduces time spent and eases workload. We have also used ML and NLP based features to create a personality prediction system. Additionally, by incorporating AI into the
current system, we can improve its characteristics. We can also put it into practice. Additionally,
we can add more machine learning algorithms to provide functionality, such suggesting a job to an applicant based on their skill set. The hiring committee's and candidates' best interests have been taken into consideration when developing this approach.
